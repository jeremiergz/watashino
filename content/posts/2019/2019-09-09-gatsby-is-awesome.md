This is the first blog post of my custom-made website.

I've discovered [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) a year ago but never took the time to get to grips with it.

The web team [@sigfox](https://www.npmjs.com/org/sigfox) have been working for some time on designing and implementing from the ground up company's Design System, named **Flive**. As I was working on the move to [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) of our web platforms my contributions were relatively small but it's been very interesting to work on this project with designers & developers, hand in hand!
