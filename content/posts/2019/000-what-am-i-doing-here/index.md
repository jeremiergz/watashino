Okay, this is the first post of my new website, powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

I really don't know what I'm doing here and if somebody will ever read this, but it's been a fun ride getting to grips with **Gatsby** making a somewhat "real" website.

Maybe my yet-to-be-born kids will one day end up on this side of the web and make fun of me. I shouldn't but I guess that would make me a happy old geek...

So, here it is, I have a personal website, big deal uh?

Yet, a question still remains, and there is nothing better than a picture to ask it:
