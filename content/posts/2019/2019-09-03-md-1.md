Colons can be used to align columns.

## Yes it is true

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

**bold text**

*italicized text*

> blockquote

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

You can export a variable like this `export { myVariable };` in JavaScript.

You can **export** a ***variable*** like this ```export { myVariable };``` in *TypeScript*.

```typescript
const theme = {
    breakpoints,
    colors,
    fonts,
    fontWeights,
};

type Theme = typeof theme;
type ThemeProps = {
    color?: keyof Theme['colors'];
    fontWeight?: keyof Theme['fontWeights'];
};

export { Theme, ThemeProps };
export default theme;
```
